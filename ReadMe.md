# Z API Test (ZAPIT)

*Zapit* is a simple Javascript-based Web API test harness that can be run from the command line and thus easily hooked into any CICD platform.

*Zapit* scripts are written using Javascript.

## Building Zapit

Use the shell scripts in the root of the project to build the *Zapit* executable for your target platform.

## Using Zapit

1. Create an empty Javascript file.
2. Write a test plan therein.
3. Run the test plan script using *Zapit*.

Execute *Zapit* with no command line parameters, or pass ```help```, for help in getting started:

#### Linux

```$ ./zapit help```

#### Mac OS

```% ./zapit-mac help```

#### Windows

```Zapit.exe help```
