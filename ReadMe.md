# Z API Test (Zapit)

Zapit is a simple Javascript-based Web API test harness that can be run from the command line and thus easily hooked into any CICD platform.

Zapit scripts are written using Javascript.

## Building Zapit

Use the shell scripts in the root of the project to build the Zapit executable for your target platform.

## Using Zapit

Create an empty Javascript file, write a test plan therein, run the test plan script using Zapit.

Execute Zapit with no command line parameters, or pass 'help', for help.

./zapit help
